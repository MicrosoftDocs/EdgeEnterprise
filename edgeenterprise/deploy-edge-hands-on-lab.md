# Microsoft Edge hands-on deployment lab

The Microsoft Edge team partnered with the Windows and Office Deployment Lab to create an area for you to test Microsoft Edge in a virtual environment. This lab automates the configuration of a virtual M365 desktop/management environment that lets you provision Microsoft Edge in a Microsoft Endpoint Configuration Manager instance.

## About the lab guides

The step-by-step lab guides will take you through multiple deployment and management scenarios. These scenarios include the latest versions of Microsoft Intune and Configuration Manager (Version 1910). You'll see Microsoft Edge has been added to the Device and App Readiness section of the step-by-step labs.
