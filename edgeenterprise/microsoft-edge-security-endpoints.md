# Allow list for Microsoft Edge endpoints

Microsoft Edge requires connectivity to the Internet to support its features. This article identifies the domain URLs that you need to add to the Allow list to ensure communications through firewalls and other security mechanisms.

> [!NOTE]
> This applies  to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.

### Download locations for Microsoft Edge

Locations Microsoft Edge can be downloaded from during an initial install or when an update is available. The download location is determined by the Update Service.
