# PDF in Microsoft Edge

PDF files constitute a substantial part of our day-to-day lives. They come in the form of contracts and agreements, newsletters, forms, research articles, resumes, and so on. This leads to a need for a reliable, secure, and powerful PDF reader that can be adopted by Enterprises to address the needs of the users in the organization.

Microsoft Edge comes with a built-in PDF reader that enables you to open your local or online pdf files, or those files embedded in web pages. They can then be annotated with ink and highlight. This enables users to have a single application for Web and PDF needs, which works across desktop platforms as Windows and Mac, and is secure and reliable.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to Microsoft Edge version 77 or later.
