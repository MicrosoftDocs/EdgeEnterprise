# PDF in Microsoft Edge

PDF files make up a substantial part of our day-to-day lives. They come in the form of contracts and agreements, newsletters, forms, research articles, resumes, and so on. This leads to a need for a reliable, secure, and powerful PDF reader that can be adopted by Enterprises to address the needs of the users in the organization.

Microsoft Edge comes with a built-in PDF reader that lets you open your local or online pdf files, or pdf files embedded in web pages. You can annotate these files with ink and highlighting. This gives users a single application to meet Web page and PDF document needs. Microsoft Edge PDF Reader is a secure and reliable application that works across the Windows and macOS desktop platforms.
