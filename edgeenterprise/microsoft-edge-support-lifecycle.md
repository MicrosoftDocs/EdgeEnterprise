# Microsoft Edge Lifecycle Policy

This article describes the lifecycle policy that applies to Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the Microsoft Edge versions 77 and higher.

## Overview of the lifecycle policy for Microsoft Edge

The next version of Microsoft Edge features more frequent and more flexible updating capabilities. Because browser releases aren't bound to the Windows major releases, it is necessary to have the governing lifecycle policy updated to reflect this. Going forward Microsoft Edge will be part of the [Modern Lifecycle Policy](https://support.microsoft.com/help/30881/modern-lifecycle-policy).

As part of this policy, the supported releases of Microsoft Edge will include the latest available release from the Beta and Stable channels.
