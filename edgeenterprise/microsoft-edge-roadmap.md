# Microsoft Edge Roadmap

This article describes the roadmap for Microsoft Edge.

## Roadmap

The web is constantly evolving to improve the user experience, security, and privacy. In some cases, changes are significant enough to impact the functionality of existing webpages.

Visit the [Site compatibility-impacting changes coming to Microsoft Edge](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/web-platform/site-impacting-changes) site to see the high-impact changes that the Microsoft Edge team is currently tracking. Check back often; the Microsoft Edge team updates this page as timelines solidify and new changes are announced.
