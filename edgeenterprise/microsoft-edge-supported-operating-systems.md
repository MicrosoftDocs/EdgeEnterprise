# Microsoft Edge Supported Operating Systems

This article describes the supported operating systems that apply to Microsoft Edge.

> [!NOTE]
> This article applies to the Microsoft Edge versions 77 and higher.

## Supported Operating Systems for Microsoft Edge

The next version of Microsoft Edge is supported on the following operating systems:

### Windows Client

- Windows 7**
- Windows 8.1
- Windows 10 SAC RS3 and later ***
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2015 LTSC
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2016 LTSC
- Windows 10 Enterprise 2019 LTSC

### Windows Server

- Windows Server 2008 R2**
- Windows Server 2012
- Windows Server 2012 R2
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019

### macOS

- Sierra (10.12) and later

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ** Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 will be supported by Microsoft Edge even after those operating systems go out of support. In order for IE mode to be supported on these operating systems the devices will need to have the [Extended Security Updates for Windows 7](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4527878/faq-about-extended-security-updates-for-windows-7). It is recommended to upgrade to a supported operating system as soon as possible in order to remain secure. Microsoft Edge being supported in this state should be considered a temporary bridge to getting to a supported OS state.
> 
> *** Similar to the above, for Windows 10 SAC releases that are out of support but Microsoft Edge is supported it is recommended to upgrade to a supported Win10 SAC release as soon as possible to remain secure. Microsoft Edge being supported in this state should be considered a temporary bridge to getting to a supported OS state.
